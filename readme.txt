== Description ==

Allows for more details reporting for the "Redirection" plugin by John Godley.  
This plugin will not do anything for you without using the Redirection plugin 
to handle your 301 redirections.  This plugin was built to fix a gap in the 
reporting which the Redirection plugin has.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload `redirection-reporting.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/redirection-reporting` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Configure the global settings through the settings page.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does this plugin do? =

This plugin simply reports on the redirection logs with day by day reporting.

= What date format should I be using? =

You should be able to use any date format.  The PHP is going to reformat it to the
way that MySQL wants to see it.
